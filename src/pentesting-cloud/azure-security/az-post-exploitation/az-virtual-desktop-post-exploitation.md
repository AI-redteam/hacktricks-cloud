### Common techniques

- Overwrite a **MSIX package from the storage account** to get RCE in any VM using that app.
- In a remoteapp it’s possible to change the **path of the binary to execute**.
- **Escape from apps** to a shell to get RCE.
- Any post exploitation attack & persistence from **Azure VMs.**
- It’s possible to **configure a script to be executed** in pool to apply custom configurations
